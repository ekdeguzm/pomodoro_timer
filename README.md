# Pomodoro Timer

I created the Pomodoro Timer because I wanted to find a way to better organize myself when studying computer science. 

The way the Pomodoro method works is simple. 

**Step 1**: set the timer for 25 minutes. 

**Step 2**: once the timer is over, take a 5 minute break. You have just completed a single pomodoro cycle. 

**Step 3**: If you complete 3 pomodoro cycles, take a longer break of 20-30 minutes. Once the long break is over, go back to step 1. 

When you open the app, there are four buttons. The POMODORO button sets the timer for 25 minutes. The BREAK button sets the timer for 5 minutes. The STOP button stops the timer. The START button resumes the timer. When the timer reaches 0, a window will pop up saying "Time's up." and a soft notification sound will play. 

I hope the application helps you with your work or studying as it has helped me!

Thank you.
